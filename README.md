# sscme | Spelis's Slow Cursor Moving Editor
text editor written in Python where you change the character manually at the cursor position

the character has to be set to a HEX value which is then turned into the correct character

so you are basically guessing the character you're typing in i guess

i just made this to fuck with people :) (fuck you)

probably gonna abandon this pretty quickly.
